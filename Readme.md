## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:
    Ensure you have Python, OpenCV, and the ultralytics YOLO library installed.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourgithub/vehicle-detection-yolov8.git
    ```

3. **Run the Detection**:
    Navigate to the cloned directory and run:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## How it Works

The script processes video frames to detect and track vehicles using YOLOv8. It then counts these vehicles as they cross a predefined line in the video, effectively estimating the flow of traffic.

- **Initialization**: Load the YOLOv8 model and start capturing video from a file.
- **Detection**: The model predicts vehicles in each frame and outputs their bounding boxes.
- **Tracking**: Custom tracking logic updates the trajectory of each detected vehicle.
- **Counting**: Vehicles crossing a predefined line are counted and the total is displayed on the output video.

## Customizations

You can adjust several parameters including the video source file, the sensitivity of the detection, and the specifics of the tracking algorithm.

For example, to change the video source:
```sh
python main.py --video_path=new_video.mp4
```

## System Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV library**
- **Ultralytics**
- **YOLO library

## Troubleshooting
No detections in the video
Ensure your model file is correctly loaded and the video file path is correct. Check if the video has clear visibility and minimal occlusions.

## Tracking issues
Adjust the tracking parameters if the vehicles are not being consistently followed across frames.

## Performance is slow
Try reducing the video resolution or using a more powerful GPU. YOLOv8 is resource-intensive.
