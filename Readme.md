## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:
    Ensure you have Python, OpenCV, and the ultralytics YOLO library installed.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourgithub/vehicle-detection-yolov8.git
    ```

3. **Run the Detection**:
    Navigate to the cloned directory and run:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## Detailed System Workflow

### Initialization and Configuration
- **Model Initialization**: Utilizes the YOLOv8s model for object detection, loaded from a pretrained model file `yolov8s.pt`.
- **Video Capture**: Captures video feed from a file `vid2.mp4`.
- **Object Classes**: Reads the classes of detectable objects like motorcycles, cars, etc., from `coco.txt`.

### Tracking Mechanism
- **Tracking Logic**: Employs a custom tracking system using the `Tracker` class to follow detected objects across frames, managing their unique IDs.
- **Updating Records**: The tracker calculates the Euclidean distance between new and existing center points of objects, reassigning IDs based on proximity within a threshold.

### Detection and Counting
- **Frame Processing**: Each video frame is processed in sequence, resized for consistency.
- **Object Detection**: YOLOv8 predicts and identifies objects within each frame, annotating them with bounding boxes.
- **Object Filtering and Counting**: Filters specific vehicle types and counts motorcycles as they cross a predefined line, displaying the count on-screen.

### Interaction and UI
- **Color Picker**: An RGB color picker activates upon mouse movement over the video, displaying RGB values at the cursor location.
- **Display Updates**: The interface continuously updates with the video feed, showing detected vehicles and the motorcycle count.

### User Interface
- **Video Display**: The "RGB" window shows the live video feed with overlays like bounding boxes and counts.
- **Control**: Allows step-by-step video progression or pausing through key presses, useful for detailed analysis.

## Customizations

You can adjust several parameters including the video source file, the sensitivity of the detection, and the specifics of the tracking algorithm.

For example, to change the video source:
```sh
python main.py --video_path=new_video.mp4
```

## System Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV library**
- **Ultralytics**
- **YOLO library**

## Troubleshooting
No detections in the video
Ensure your model file is correctly loaded and the video file path is correct. Check if the video has clear visibility and minimal occlusions.

## Tracking issues
Adjust the tracking parameters if the vehicles are not being consistently followed across frames.

## Performance is slow
Try reducing the video resolution or using a more powerful GPU. YOLOv8 is resource-intensive.
